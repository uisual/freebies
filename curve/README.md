# Curve: Free Landing Page Template from Uisual

Curve is free for personal and commercial projects. You can use Curve to promote your app, sell your ebook, etc. All we ask is a one-line attribution in your `<head>...</head>` document. However, you're not allowed to republish, redistribute, or resell Curve (with or without modification). Also, you can't use Curve to create a similar product like website builder or free landing page gallery (even if they're free).
